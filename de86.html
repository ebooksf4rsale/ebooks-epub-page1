    <h2>Becoming Supernatural: How Common People are Doing the Uncommon </h2>
    <div class="author">
      <p>by Joe Dispenza (Author), Gregg Braden (Foreword)    </p>
      <p>Format: <span>EPUB</span></p>
    </div>
   
    <hr>
    <h3>
        A WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER by DR. JOE DISPENZA , the author of the New York Times bestseller "You Are the Placebo", as well as "Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself" and "Evolve Your Brain".
    </h3>

    <p>
        "Becoming Supernatural" draws on epigenetics, quantum physics & neuroscience research conducted at his advanced workshops since 2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform their consciousness, mindset, and beliefs to heal and live SUPERNATURAL lives.
<br><br>
"Becoming Supernatural" marries some of the most profound scientific information with ancient spiritual wisdom to show how people like you and me can experience a more mystical life.
<br><br>
Readers will learn that we are, quite literally supernatural by nature if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when we learn how to apply that information through various healing meditations, we should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities.
<br><br>
We have the capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material world and receive more orderly coherent streams of consciousness and energy; that we can intentionallychange our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences; and how, if we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a more efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater access to the quantum field and the realms of spiritual truth.
<br><br>
Topics include:
<br><br>• Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal
<br><br>• How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind
<br><br>• How you can create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy
<br><br>• The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation
<br><br>• The secret science of the pineal gland and its role in accessing mystical realms of reality
<br><br>• The distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities
<br><br>• And much more
<br><br>
Chapters Include:
<br><br>
Opening the Door to the Supernatural
<br>The Present Moment
<br>Tuning In to New Potentials in the Quantum
<br>Blessing of the Energy Centers
<br>Reconditioning the Body to a New Mind
<br>Case Studies: Living Examples of Truth
<br>Heart Intelligence
<br>Mind Movies/Kaleidoscope
<br>Walking Meditation
<br>Case Studies: Making It Real
<br>Space-Time and Time-Space
<br>The Pineal Gland
<br>Project Coherence: Making a Better World
<br>Case Studies: It Could Happen to You
<br><br>
Using tools and disciplines ranging from cutting-edge physics to practical exercises such as a walking meditation, Dr. Joe offers nothing less than a proven program for stepping outside our physical reality and into the quantum field of infinite possibilities.
<br><br>
“In a style that is simple, straightforward, and easy to understand, Dr. Joe Dispenza has woven into a single volume the paradigm-altering discoveries of quantum science and the deep teachings that adepts of the past dedicated their entire lifetimes to master.”
— Gregg Braden, New York Times best-selling author of "Human by Design" and "The Divine Matrix"
<br><br>
“We can create better lives for ourselves—and that we are not linear beings living linear lives, but dimensional beings living dimensional lives. Hopefully, reading it will help you understand that you already have all the anatomy, chemistry, and physiology you need to become supernatural sitting latent within you, waiting to be awakened and activated.” - Dr. Joe Dispenza
