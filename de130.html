    <h2>Secret Millionaires Club: Warren Buffett's 26 Secrets to Success in the Business of Life  </h2>

    <h3>
      Priceless finance advice everyone can relate to from one of the world's most respected businessmen and the most successful investor of all time
    </h3>

    <p>
      Of course you know who Warren Buffett is; he's the most successful investor in the worldâ€”maybe of all times. But what do you know about his approach to business and investing? It's an approach that, over the past four decades, has made him richest man in America and the third-richest man in the world, and that has earned vast fortunes for his business partners and investors. But as Buffett himself will tell you, at the heart of any wealth-building system there are certain core beliefs, not just about finance, but about business, work, morality, your responsibility to yourself, your family and society, and about living a decent life. Written in conjunction with the hit television series, "Secret Millionaire Club" and with Buffett's input and full support, this book makes Buffett's financial philosophy and homespun life lessons available to everyone outside his "Secret Club."
<br><br>
Warren Buffet's goal in spearheading this book was to share lessons about personal finance he has learned and that he hopes will benefit you (and your kids) for a lifetime
<br><br>You'll learn the fundamentals of personal finance by reading Warren Buffett's war stories and personal reflections on money, life, business, ethics and more
<br><br>All of the finance principles covered in the book were personally approved by Warren Buffett as those which he himself follows
<br><br>Unforgettable Buffett quotes include: "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get"; "Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing"; and "Profit from folly rather than participate in it."
